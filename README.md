## Two related deadlines

### 1. Complete 6 problems per week

- **Mix:** 2 Easy, 3 Medium, 1 Hard (attempts count)
- **Scope:** Can be reduced only after missing a deadline. Goal is a sustainable pace every week.

### 2. Review 5–8 problems per week

- **Time:** 120 mins per week
- **Rule:** Problems you can’t clearly explain get moved back to NEW
- **Scope:** Can be reduced if needed
